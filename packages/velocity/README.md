**Comparisons**

Famo.us is a full-fledged app framework built around a physics engine. It has the potential to beat all DOM-based animation libraries in terms of performance. The amount of work Steve Newcomb and Mark Lu have put into vertically integrating the Famous development stack is astounding.

GSAP is a full-fledged animation suite with a ton of power. Its features are nearly limitless -- as is the love its creator (Jack Doyle) puts into it. GSAP is what inspired me to pursue the development of Velocity.

As for Velocity, its focus is on being a very lightweight, very fast tool for drastically improving UI animation performance and workflow. I've dedicated the last three months of my life to it.

With each of these solutions, we're comparing options that are the product of nothing but pure love -- for performance and for the Web. Enjoy them for what they are. Choose whichever is best suited to your task at-hand. They're all very fast.
